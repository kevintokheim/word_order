#### By Logan Wu & Kevin Tokheim

## Description

This is an app which allows the user to input a sentence and returns the number of unique words that appear. For example, if the user inputs "Hello World", the app would return "hello: 1, world: 1" in that order. The list is ordered by the number of appearances from the greatest to least number of appearances. For words that appear the same amount of times, the word which appeared first is ordered first.
